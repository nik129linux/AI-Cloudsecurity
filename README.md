## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository documents my journey to becoming a **Cloud & AI Security Engineer**.

Every folder represents a week of solving real-world engineering problems, moving from foundational Infrastructure as Code (IaC) to advanced Adversarial AI and Automated Compliance.

My goal is not just to "use" the cloud, but to engineer secure, scalable, and automated environments following **Security by Design** principles.

## 🛠️  The Tech Stack
*   **Cloud:** AWS (VPC, IAM, EC2, S3, Bedrock, Nova)
*   **IaC:** Terraform (Modular, State-managed, Enterprise-grade)
*   **Automation:** Python (Boto3 SDK), Bash
*   **Security:** IAM Advanced, SCPs, Security Groups, MLSecOps

## 📂 Repository Structure

| Week | Focus | Key Projects | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **01** | **Foundation & IaC** | Secure VPC deployment with Terraform, IAM Roles & Instance Profiles | ✅ Completed |
| **02** | **Security Automation** | Python scripts for vulnerability scanning (Boto3) | 🚧 In Progress |
| **03** | **AI Security** | Integrating Amazon Bedrock & Nova 2 | 📅 Upcoming |
| **04-12**| **Enterprise Projects** | MLSecOps, GRC Automation, Threat Detection | 📅 Upcoming |

## 💡 Philosophy
*   **Identity First:** No hardcoded keys. Always use IAM Roles and ephemeral credentials.
*   **Immutable Infrastructure:** Never click in the console. If it's not in Terraform, it doesn't exist.
*   **Build in Public:** Documenting the process, the errors, and the solutions.
